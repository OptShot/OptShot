## üöÄ  Basic Usage

1. Launch the game in either **Fullscreen Windowed** mode or **Windowed** mode:

   > If you choose 'Windowed' mode, please ensure the window remains centered on your screen.

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Calibration

üèÉ **Movement Factor**

> The higher this value, the greater the distance the mouse will move.

Due to differences in mouse DPI, game resolution, and in-game Mouse Sensitivity settings, it's necessary to calibrate the mouse movement range to ensure accurate targeting.

Procedure: 

1ÔºâOpen a practice map and keep the bot stationary. 

2ÔºâSlightly move the mouse pointer away from the bot.

3ÔºâPress **F6** to execute a single "Capture- Detection - Mouse Movement" precedure.  Adjust this value until a single detection accurately aligns with the character.



‚è±Ô∏è **Rest Time Factor**

>  Increasing this factor extends the waiting time.

After mouse movement, the screen doesn't immediately change. Therefore, it's necessary to wait for a period before continuing detection; otherwise, premature detection might lead to incorrect mouse movement and significant drift. Typically, a value of 0.3 is appropriate.



### üöÄ Nvidia CUDA Acceleration

By default, the AI detection algorithm runs on the CPU. For Nvidia graphics cards, you can utilize CUDA to accelerate detection speed, usually resulting in a 100% to 300% speed boost.

However, be aware that if your GPU is already exhausted by the game, the detection speed might be slower than CPU. In such cases, you can:

1. Limit CS's maximum frame rate via console command `fps_max 60`.
2. Lower the game's graphics quality or resolution.



## ‚ùîFrequently Asked Questions

**1. Does it support games other than CS2?**

In theory, yes, but the software is not optimized for these games.



**2. How it works?**

The software captures a 640x640 area at the screen center, employs AI object detection (Yolo-V8) to locate characters within it, and then controls the mouse for aiming.
